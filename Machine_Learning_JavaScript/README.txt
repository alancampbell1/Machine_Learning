Machine Learning using JavaScript:

Neural Network: This is an artificial network of interconnected groups of nodes, similar to the network of neurons in the brain.
Neural Networks are known as 'feed forward'. The data moves through it in a single direction. This allows us to conduct what is known as 'deep learning'. We can feed the network vast amounts of data and it can be trained to interpret that data and make predictions. 
Neural Networks can perform tasks, create outputs or make predictions by analysing 'training sets/examples/data'.
Data is key in neural networks. A small dataset means the quality of output will be very low. So, the more data, the more accurate your results and outputs are.

A common example is inputting a series of images of dogs, cats and fish. You are training the network to identify what is a dog, cat or fish based on the dataset you provided. So when you input a new image, the computer can immediately identify if it is a dog, cat or fish. You are training the PC.
 
You have input nodes, hidden nodes and output nodes.

The task of this project is to take the data from the table image and create a neural network from it. We will pre-program a series of inputs and outputs from which the PC should recognise the patterns developed.
We will then feed it an unique input, not recognised or preprocessed already, and get the PC to accurately determine the correct answer.
In our table example, 100 should produce 1 and the PC should figure this out themselves.
